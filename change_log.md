02/07/25 - The codes for the main.py, fac_check.py, capture_face.py is uploaded but the code need to be worked because module not found error is not fixing


12/07/25- Integrated the face_check.py module with the main.py GUI to enable secure face recognition-based authentication using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. Refactored the GUI logic to trigger facial verification before granting access to the vault. Ensured modular separation of concerns for better maintainability. The face data is now loaded from a known image (shreyansh_fixed.jpg) stored in the known_faces/ directory. (still some function like open vault is not working it is still to be worked on)


17/07/25 - Face_check.py is updated

27/07/25 The project has run into complication, i have to make changes to tech stack, since face_recognition module support Python 2.10.x version, and I am sick of creating virtual environment, *I have decide to shift to DEEPFACE module of python for the same functionality, we will soon see the end of this project*

01/08/25 - Deepface code intergrated, issue generated need to be fixed, this projects need to be finished soon
